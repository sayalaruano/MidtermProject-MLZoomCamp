# MidtermProject-MLZoomCamp
For my midterm project of the [Machine Learning Zoomcamp](https://github.com/alexeygrigorev/mlbookcamp-code/tree/master/course-zoomcamp), I decided to work in the Open Bioinformatics Research Project proposed by [Data Professor](https://github.com/dataprofessor). More information about this project in this [video](https://youtu.be/_GtEgiWWyK4)
